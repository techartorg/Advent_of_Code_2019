Dim MODULEWEIGHT(100)
REM It appears as if file operations aren't working in AMOS2 (yet?) so I had to Dim a 100 element array and paste in my input here.

totalfuel = 0
For i = 0 to 99
	modulefuel = Int(MODULEWEIGHT(i) / 3) - 2
	additionalfuel = modulefuel

	While additionalfuel > 0
		additionalfuel = Int(additionalfuel / 3) - 2
		If additionalfuel > 0
			modulefuel = modulefuel + additionalfuel		
		End If
	Wend

	totalfuel = totalfuel + modulefuel
Next

Print totalfuel
