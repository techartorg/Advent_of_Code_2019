REM It appears as if file operations aren't working in AMOS2 (yet?) so I had to Dim a 100 element array and paste in my input here.

totalweight = 0
For i = 0 to 99
	weight = ( MODULEWEIGHT(i) / 3 ) - 2
	totalweight = totalweight + weight
Next

Print totalweight

weight# = 4.9
print Int(weight#)
